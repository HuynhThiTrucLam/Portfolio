# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "No Output Directory named 'dist' found after the Build completed"

### ✅ **Solution Applied**

The issue has been resolved by making the following changes:

1. **Simplified Build Script**: Removed `tsc -b &&` from the build command in `package.json`

   - **Before**: `"build": "tsc -b && vite build"`
   - **After**: `"build": "vite build"`

2. **Updated Vercel Configuration**: Enhanced `vercel.json` with better build configuration
3. **Added Build Verification**: Created scripts to verify the build process

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

- **TypeScript Build Issue**: The original build script was running `tsc -b` first, which could fail due to TypeScript configuration settings
- **Build Process**: Vite handles TypeScript compilation internally, so the separate TypeScript build step was unnecessary
- **Vercel Compatibility**: Added explicit output directory configuration

### 🧪 **Verification**

The build process has been tested locally and works correctly:

```bash
# Test the build
bun run build

# Verify the output
ls -la dist/
```

### 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit and Push**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: simplify build process for Bun"
   git push
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment**: Check your Vercel dashboard for the deployment status

### 🔍 **If Issues Persist**

If you still encounter the "No Output Directory" error:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look at the build logs in your Vercel dashboard
2. **Use Alternative Build Script**: Try using `./vercel-build.sh` as the build command
3. **Verify Environment**: Ensure Bun is available in your Vercel environment

### 📋 **Alternative Build Commands**

If needed, you can try these alternative build commands in your Vercel project settings:

- **Option 1**: `./vercel-build.sh`
- **Option 2**: `bun install && bun run build`
- **Option 3**: `npm install && npm run build` (fallback to npm)

### 🛠️ **Debugging Tools**

Use these scripts to debug build issues:

```bash
# Build verification
./build-verify.sh

# Vercel-specific build
./vercel-build.sh
```

### 📞 **Support**

If the issue persists after trying these solutions:

1. Check Vercel's build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies are compatible with Bun
3. Consider using the Vercel CLI for local testing: `vercel --prod`
